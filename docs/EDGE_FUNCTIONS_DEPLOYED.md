# Edge Functions Deployment Complete ✅

## Status: LIVE & ACTIVE

Both Supabase Edge Functions are now deployed and ready for production use:

- ✅ **ai-suggestions** - ACTIVE - Generates AI suggestions for task/accomplishment descriptions
- ✅ **ai-validate** - ACTIVE - Validates submissions against quality rules
- ✅ **admin-magic-link** - ACTIVE - Admin-only: generates one-time magic login links for any user

## Live Endpoints

```
BASE: https://apcfnzbiylhgiutcjigg.supabase.co/functions/v1

POST /ai-suggestions → Generate 3 AI suggestions (GPT-4)
POST /ai-validate → Validate submission with quality scoring (GPT-4)
POST /admin-magic-link → Generate one-time login link for any user (admin-only, JWT required)
```

## Final Step: Set OpenAI API Key Secret

The Edge Functions are deployed but need the `OPENAI_API_KEY` secret to work.

### How to Set the Secret:

**Option A: Supabase Dashboard (Easiest)**
1. Go to https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project: `apcfnzbiylhgiutcjigg`
3. Left sidebar → **Project Settings**
4. Click **Functions** (under Integrations)
5. Click **Add secret** button
6. Name: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
7. Value: Get from `server/.env` (stored locally - check your OPENAI_API_KEY value)
8. Paste your OpenAI API key (from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
9. Click **Add secret**
10. Functions will automatically restart with the new secret ✅

**Option B: Supabase CLI**
```bash
# Get your API key from server/.env file
supabase secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here --project-id apcfnzbiylhgiutcjigg
```

## Test the Deployment

Once the secret is set, test in the dashboard:

1. Go to Edge Functions → **ai-suggestions**
2. Click **Testing** tab
3. Paste in Request body:
```json
{
  "fieldType": "why",
  "currentText": "Used ChatGPT to analyze customer feedback data",
  "context": null
}
```
4. Click **Invoke**
5. Should see 3 AI suggestions returned ✅

## How Employees Will Use It

1. Any employee creates a new **Task** or **Accomplishment**
2. Clicks **✨ AI Suggestions** button
3. Gets 3 GPT-4 powered suggestions automatically
4. Clicks one to apply → suggestion fills the field
5. Field-specific validation ensures quality before submission
